# 📱 Best App Design Projects (UI/UX)

This repository showcases some of my finest app design projects — built with a focus on usability, clean interface, and real-world design problems. These UI/UX projects are created using modern design principles, and many are prototyped in **Figma**.

From productivity apps to e-commerce and educational platforms, each design solves a specific problem with clarity and creativity.
